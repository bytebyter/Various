Can't exactly remember what this project is, but appears to be an attempt to represent the various shape of objects using triangles. (Using as pseudo marching squares method.)

This program requires a compiled version of Trianlge to be in the same directory as it is in order to run.
Triangle can be found here http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html.
